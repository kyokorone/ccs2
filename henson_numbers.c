#include<stdio.h>
/*
Write a program that will ask for an integer input (1 - 9999). Your program will convert the inputted integer into its corresponding word format in English. See examples below:

Example 1:

Input number: 2481

Output: two thousand four hundred eighty one

Example 2:

Input number: 616

Output: six hundred sixteen

Example 3:

Input number: 30

Output: thirty

- Make sure to trap your input. Any integer input below 1 or above 9999 is an invalid input. In case of an invalid input, the program will display an error message and will exit the program.

-Submit your .C file.

- Find a way to be able to extract each digit according to its place value.

- VERY IMPORTANT: THE SOLUTION DOES NOT USE 9999 IF-STATEMENTS!

- Be careful on the numbers from 10 - 19.
